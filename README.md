# Veteran Websites – Hypermarket (Tailwind Edition)

A veteran-level hypermarket website built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## Project Overview

This project represents a **veteran-level front-end website**, marking the evolution from  
**framework-based component usage (Bootstrap)** to a more **utility-first and architecture-focused development approach** using Tailwind CSS.

Unlike traditional component-heavy frameworks, this version emphasizes:

- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Scalable structure
- Reusable UI patterns
- Design consistency through utility composition

It belongs to the `veteran-websites` category and demonstrates the ability to work confidently with **modern styling methodologies and professional front-end structuring principles**.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout using **Tailwind’s utility-first system**.
- Custom UI components built through utility composition.
- Clean separation between:
  - Layout structure
  - UI components
  - JavaScript behavior
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints.
- Minimal custom CSS through Tailwind configuration and utilities.
- Scalable design system powered by:
  - Reusable utility patterns
  - Consistent spacing and typography scale
- JavaScript-driven interactivity with clean responsibility separation.

## Architecture Approach

This edition introduces a more professional responsibility-based structure:

- **Layout Layer** – Global page structure and grid organization.
- **Component Layer** – Reusable UI blocks built using utility composition.
- **Utility Layer** – Tailwind configuration and design tokens.
- **Behavior Layer** – JavaScript logic separated from presentation.

This approach promotes:

- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier migration to modern frameworks like React, Vue, or Next.js

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible markup.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Interactivity and DOM behavior.
- **PostCSS / Tailwind Config** – Custom theme configuration and optimization.

---

## Learning Goals

This project helps practice and reinforce:

- Utility-first development with Tailwind CSS.
- Building reusable UI patterns without pre-built components.
- Designing scalable front-end architectures.
- Separating structure, styling, and behavior responsibly.
- Preparing for modern component-based frameworks.
